# Sorting_Visualizer
The Sorting Visualizer Project in Python utilizes the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort and quicksort. Users can input a list, select a sorting algorithm, and observe the real-time sorting process through interactive visualizations.
